KerbalFeels is a mod for Kerbal Space Program which will add a new element to the game of interpersonal relationships between kerbals.

Based on the different personalities of the kerbals (and RNG) kerbals will like or dislike each other after spending time alone with each other in spacecraft.

Once they reach a certain threshold of liking (or disliking) another kerbal, they will gain a certain "feeling" towards the other kerbal. When they are on a mission, they will gain or lose personality traits and experience levels based on their feelings towards the other kerbals on their mission.  These feelings are:

Positive traits give +1 experience level:
- Playful: Raises stupidity
- In Love: Raises stupidity and courage
- Inspired: Lowers stupidity

Negative traits give -1 experience level:
- Scared
- Annoyed
- Hateful

Kerbals also have a certain amount of "sanity" which will depreciate over longer missions.  Sanity will impact the amount that RNG impacts their feelings towards the other kerbals.

Right now the only GUI that you will see is when a ship is recovered, you will be informed of the kerbals changing feelings towards each other at the end of every mission.

Things on the to do list:
- Feelings impact the amount of experience gained from a mission (inspired gives more xp, playful gives less)
- Kerbacide! Will happen with negative feelings + lack of sanity + RNG
- Parts ideas: 
	Rec center for space stations will reduce negative feelings all around and improve sanity
	Brain scan gives science and is either affected by or has effects on kerbal's sanity
- Tweaking to constant variables after testing and/or feedback
